        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Creating meaningful work, as an artist, has been one of the primary passions of my life for the last 20 years. Graduating with a BFA in Ceramics in 1998 <em>(Alfred University)</em>, I began utilizing my passion for teaching as well. I have taught in South Korea, Poland, Texas, Michigan, New York, and Oregon. I was also blessed to get an MA in Ceramics <em>(Central Michigan University),</em> and an MFA in Visual Arts <em>(Azusa Pacific University)</em>. The last twenty years have found me plenty of opportunities for exhibition, and exploration. Along the way I have had the opportunity to experience a multitude of artistic and educational settings, ideologies and creative pathways. Through working with other artists and students, I have grown to respect and enjoy the many ways people find their creative voice, passion and calling.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is this variety of experience that has led me to create <em>Rosselle Studios</em>. Throughout my career as an artist-teacher I have found that opening up your creative practice to collaboration, new art media, and divergent ways of thinking about the creative process leads to new and dynamic work.  While, ceramics will always be my first love when it comes to art materials, I also love painting, fibers, mixed media, and installation art. Collaborating and seeking the insight of other creative individuals both in and out of the art field has also lead to important dialogues within my work.
        </p>
        <p>
          At <em>Rosselle Studios</em>, I hope to create:
          <dl>
            <dt>
              Work that is <strong>Accessible:</strong>
            </dt>
            <dd>
              I seek to make unique artwork that can be seen and experienced in a variety of contexts, by a variety of people.  It is also my hope to make work that accessible in size, cost, and display.
            </dd>
            <dt>
              Work that has <strong>Longevity:</strong>
            </dt>
            <dd>
              Thinking of the life cycle of an artwork has become an important aspect of my creative process. Considering ceramics (as well as many other art media) survives well beyond their creators, I have grown to desire that my work have longevity through its craftsmanship and creation.
            </dd>
            <dt>
              Work that <strong>Provokes:</strong>
            </dt>

            <dd>
              I am a meaning maker at heart. I value both the aesthetic qualities of my work, and the ideas embedded in the art I create. My hope is to create work that develops a relationship with its viewer.
            </dd>
          </dl>
          As an artist, my work and creative process often reveals three main narrative arcs:
          <ol>
            <li>
              <em>Faith</em>: I find solace and meaning in the sacred. My faith journey has been in the Christian tradition. The push and pull of devotion and doubt seeps through my creative process and my created work.
            </li>
            <li>
              Chronic Illness: For all of my adult life I have had Multiple Sclerosis, and for over a decade I have known to call my health struggles by that name. The wondrous and pernicious nature of a life where one’s body struggles against itself is often represented through visual dichotomies in my work.
            </li>
            <li>
              Beauty and the Grotesque: Beauty in chaos, elegance in the mundane, brilliance in the absurd… I am attracted to beauty and to the grotesque. I am interested in the push and pull of what makes people look more closely. The visual cacophony of what we see- its unique and unusual attributes are the fuel of my inspiration.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
